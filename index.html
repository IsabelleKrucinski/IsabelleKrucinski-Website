        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Isabelle Krucinski. I am a nineteen-year-old freshman attending the University of California, Riverside. I am currently a Pre-Business major. Once I am accepted into the UCR School of Business, I plan on concentrating in either marketing or business administration. I also plan on studying abroad in either my junior year or senior year in order to build my twenty-first-century skills. While abroad, I plan to pursue an internship that in my field that will help me build the necessary skills needed to excel in my future line of work. This experience will help me broaden my cultural scope as well. 
<br><br>
I was valedictorian of my high school, and I tutored students struggling in math and history. I would arrive at the library early in the mornings every week in order to assist my peers who are struggling. I have spent countless hours furthering the education of my community. Additionally, I held a position as an assistant to my high school PE teacher when she had Summer School classes. I would drive to school during my break in order to help her with tasks such as team building, setting up equipment, doing the laundry, and any other task she would assign to me. This experience helped me build my time management and communication skills.
Additionally, I volunteered at a multitude of locations. I frequently volunteered for Keep Riverside Beautiful and Clean. While volunteering for this organization, I would go pick up trash in many locations around Riverside such as its parks and public libraries. Also, I was able to have the opportunity to plant flowers and other foliage around the freeway onramps in order to better improve the environment. Furthermore, I was able to rid the city of graffiti while I was working as a graffiti clean-up crew. I am proud to say I helped foster a clean and healthy environment for my community.  
I also volunteered at the Lake Mathewâ€™s Turkey Trot, a marathon that took place on the morning of Thanksgiving in my community. I would help direct the runners as to where to go, and I would set up supplies and hand out waters for the runners. I also volunteered at the Ronald McDonald House. I had the privilege of creating Halloween goodie bags for the children there and handing out these goodie bags to the children before Halloween. Furthermore, I would assist my fourth-grade elementary teacher with grading homework and setting up her classroom whenever I had the chance. I also volunteered at RUSDâ€™s Annual Parent Engagement Summit. I was assigned to be the assistant of an immigration lawyer who delivered an information session to many parents who are undocumented immigrants.
<br><br>I was also involved in a multitude of clubs during high school. I was president of ALAS, a club designed to encourage students to do volunteer work. I was also a board member of my schoolâ€™s Biomedical Sciences club. I was also involved in the Chemistry Club, Art Club, STEM club, California Scholarship Federation, and National Honors Society. I was also treasurer of the STEM club.
